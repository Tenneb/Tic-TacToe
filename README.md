# Tic-TacToe
Just a little Tic-Tac-Toe game I programmed in Java.
The User can select who is first and if his/her opponent is another player or the MasterBot. 
By the way: The Masterbot is unbeatable.
Dont be confused by the strategy used by the MasterBot. I included two pictures that illustrate it.

Special thanks to Skim and to Gerhard Röhner, the creator of the Java-Editor, the application I used to program this Tic-Tac-Toe (http://javaeditor.org/doku.php)

Note: In case you find some German comments in the code do not wonder. I am German.
